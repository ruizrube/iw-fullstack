## Setting up the application

Open application.properties and modify the following database server (e.g. MySQL) properties:
- spring.datasource.url
- spring.datasource.username
- spring.datasource.password

Open application.properties and modify the following mail server (e.g. Gmail) properties:

- spring.mail.host
- spring.mail.port
- spring.mail.username
- spring.mail.password

*If you use Google SMTP then you need to generate an application password. To do this go to your account settings > Security > How do you sign in to Google > 2-Step Verification > Application passwords*

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more
on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (
Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).




## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/fullstackwebapp-1.0.0.jar`
